However, it is challenging to track hologenome dynamics because of the large amount of material, with tracking itself usually resulting in damage or death of the research object. Here we show the simple and efficient holo-2bRAD approach for the tracking of hologenome dynamics in marine invertebrates (i.e., scallop and shrimp) from one holo-2bRAD library. The stable performance of our approach was shown with high genotyping accuracy of 99.91% and a high correlation of r\\u2009>\\u20090.99 for the species-level profiling of microorganisms. To explore the host-microbe association underlying mass mortality events of bivalve larvae, core microbial species changed with the stages were found, and two potentially associated host SNPs were identified. Overall, our research provides a powerful tool with various advantages (e.g., cost-effective, simple, and applicable for challenging samples) in genetic, ecological, and evolutionary studies.\",\n          \"Oral diseases are often caused by bacterial infections, making the inhibition of receptors like N-acetylglucosamine critical in preventing bacterial formation. The plant Myrmecodia pendans (M. pendans) is known for its diverse bioactivities and may serve as a promising source for developing new antibacterial agents. This study employs in silico methods to predict the inhibitory mechanisms, pharmacokinetics, and drug-likeness of compounds isolated from M. pendans. Three compounds were evaluated for their inhibitory effects on the MurA and MurB receptors using the AutoDock4 molecular docking software, with visualizations performed using the BIOVIA Discovery Studio Visualizer. The binding affinities obtained for compounds 1, 2, and 3 to the MurA receptor were \\u22129.42, \\u22129.57, and \\u22126.84\\u2009kcal/mol, respectively, while their binding affinities to the MurB receptor were \\u221211.25, \\u221210.55, and \\u22128.69\\u2009kcal/mol. These affinities were found to be stronger than those of fosfomycin (benchmark compound) but weaker than the native ligands of the respective receptors. Key amino acid residues involved in the binding to MurA were identified as Cys115 and Asp305, while Ser82 and Asn83 were noted for MurB. In the ADMET prediction and drug-likeness analysis, some compounds met the necessary criteria, whereas others did not. Although all the three compounds demonstrated strong predicted inhibitory activity against MurA and MurB receptors, the analysis suggests that Compound 2 may hold the most promise as a potential antibacterial agent, warranting further investigation.\",\n          \"Leptospirosis is an important zoonosis that is caused by pathogenic Leptospira, which is considered to be a re-emerging infectious disease in many countries. Rodents are the most important reservoirs for both human and animal infection. An epidemiological survey of pathogenic Leptospira in rodents is important for the prevention and control of leptospirosis. In this study, a total of 964 rodents were captured from six cities in Hubei Province, and two pathogenic Leptospira species (L.\\u00a0interrogans and L.\\u00a0borgpetersenii) were detected using nested PCR with an overall prevalence of 4.8%. L.\\u00a0interrogans was distributed in five sampling sites, which may be the dominant species of pathogenic Leptospira in Hubei Province. In addition, Rattus norvegicus showed a relatively high infection rate, which may play an important role in the transmission and infection of pathogenic Leptospira.

However, it is challenging to track hologenome dynamics because of the large amount of material, with tracking itself usually resulting in damage or death of the research object. Here we show the simple and efficient holo-2bRAD approach for the tracking of hologenome dynamics in marine invertebrates (i.e., scallop and shrimp) from one holo-2bRAD library. The stable performance of our approach was shown with high genotyping accuracy of 99.91% and a high correlation of r\\u2009>\\u20090.99 for the species-level profiling of microorganisms. To explore the host-microbe association underlying mass mortality events of bivalve larvae, core microbial species changed with the stages were found, and two potentially associated host SNPs were identified. Overall, our research provides a powerful tool with various advantages (e.g., cost-effective, simple, and applicable for challenging samples) in genetic, ecological, and evolutionary studies.\",\n          \"Oral diseases are often caused by bacterial infections, making the inhibition of receptors like N-acetylglucosamine critical in preventing bacterial formation. The plant Myrmecodia pendans (M. pendans) is known for its diverse bioactivities and may serve as a promising source for developing new antibacterial agents. This study employs in silico methods to predict the inhibitory mechanisms, pharmacokinetics, and drug-likeness of compounds isolated from M. pendans. Three compounds were evaluated for their inhibitory effects on the MurA and MurB receptors using the AutoDock4 molecular docking software, with visualizations performed using the BIOVIA Discovery Studio Visualizer. The binding affinities obtained for compounds 1, 2, and 3 to the MurA receptor were \\u22129.42, \\u22129.57, and \\u22126.84\\u2009kcal/mol, respectively, while their binding affinities to the MurB receptor were \\u221211.25, \\u221210.55, and \\u22128.69\\u2009kcal/mol. These affinities were found to be stronger than those of fosfomycin (benchmark compound) but weaker than the native ligands of the respective receptors. Key amino acid residues involved in the binding to MurA were identified as Cys115 and Asp305, while Ser82 and Asn83 were noted for MurB. In the ADMET prediction and drug-likeness analysis, some compounds met the necessary criteria, whereas others did not. Although all the three compounds demonstrated strong predicted inhibitory activity against MurA and MurB receptors, the analysis suggests that Compound 2 may hold the most promise as a potential antibacterial agent, warranting further investigation.\",\n          \"Leptospirosis is an important zoonosis that is caused by pathogenic Leptospira, which is considered to be a re-emerging infectious disease in many countries. Rodents are the most important reservoirs for both human and animal infection. An epidemiological survey of pathogenic Leptospira in rodents is important for the prevention and control of leptospirosis. In this study, a total of 964 rodents were captured from six cities in Hubei Province, and two pathogenic Leptospira species (L.\\u00a0interrogans and L.\\u00a0borgpetersenii) were detected using nested PCR with an overall prevalence of 4.8%. L.\\u00a0interrogans was distributed in five sampling sites, which may be the dominant species of pathogenic Leptospira in Hubei Province. In addition, Rattus norvegicus showed a relatively high infection rate, which may play an important role in the transmission and infection of pathogenic Leptospira. This study reveals the prevalence of pathogenic Leptospira in wild rodents in Hubei Province, suggesting that the risk of leptospirosis infection in Hubei Province still exists.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Paper_type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Journal Article']\",\n          \"['Journal Article', 'News']\",\n          \"['Journal Article', 'Review']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Affiliation\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 37437,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Department of Mental Health - Manzoni Hospital, Lecco, Italy', \\\"Centre de recherche de l'Institut Universitaire en Sant\\u00e9 Mentale, Universit\\u00e9 de Montr\\u00e9al, Montreal, Canada\\\", 'Centre for MH Law & Policy, Indian Law Society, Pune, India', 'Department of Community Mental Health, Faculty of Welfare and Health Sciences, University of Haifa, Israel']\",\n          \"['0000 0001 2097 0141grid.121334.6UMR INTERTRYP, University of Montpellier, IRD, CIRAD, Montpellier, France', '0000 0001 2097 0141grid.121334.6UMR INTERTRYP, University of Montpellier, IRD, CIRAD, Montpellier, France', '0000 0001 2097 0141grid.121334.6UMR INTERTRYP, University of Montpellier, IRD, CIRAD, Montpellier, France', '0000 0001 2153 9871grid.8183.2CIRAD, UMR ASTRE, F-34398, Montpellier, France', 'VIRBAC Animal Health, Carros, France', '0000 0001 2097 0141grid.121334.6UMR INTERTRYP, University of Montpellier, IRD, CIRAD, Montpellier, France', '0000 0001 2097 0141grid.121334.6UMR INTERTRYP, University of Montpellier, IRD, CIRAD, Montpellier, France', '0000 0001 2097 0141grid.121334.6UMR INTERTRYP, University of Montpellier, IRD, CIRAD, Montpellier, France']\",\n          \"['Institute of Applied Biosciences, Center for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece', 'Laboratory of Anatomy and Physiology of Farm Animals, Department of Animal Science, School of Animal Biosciences, Agricultural University of Athens, Athens, Greece', 'Laboratory of Animal Husbandry, Faculty of Health Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece', 'Laboratory of Animal Husbandry, Faculty of Health Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Center for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}],"source":["table_1_with_PT = df.drop(df[df[\"Paper_type\"] == \"No paper type\"].index)\n","table_1_with_PT"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":347,"status":"ok","timestamp":1735817832906,"user":{"displayName":"Aliyu D Abdullahi","userId":"02187426347476081881"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"d-QsHHBrJnSO","outputId":"68bc77c8-68b4-4d22-c271-be885887b6d2"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","RangeIndex: 44394 entries, 0 to 44393\n","Data columns (total 7 columns):\n"," #

Disease transmission rate depends on the intra-subject viral load determined from the immunological submodel. The age-dependent model includes the viral load, recovery and death rates as functions of age considered as a continuous variable. Equations for susceptible, infected, recovered and dead compartments are expressed in terms of the number of newly infected cases. The analysis of the model includes the proof of the existence and uniqueness of solution. Furthermore, it is shown how the model can be reduced to age-dependent SIR or delay model under certain assumptions on recovery and death distributions. Basic reproduction number and final size of epidemic are determined for the reduced models. The model is validated with a COVID-19 case data. Modelling results show that proportion of young age groups can influence the epidemic progression since disease transmission rate for them is higher than for other age groups.\",\n          \"Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is early marked by kidney glomerular hyperfiltration. However, the association of NAFLD with kidney glomerular hyperfiltration has not been tested so far in adults with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Aims: To assess the relationship between NAFLD and kidney glomerular hyperfiltration in adults with MetS. Methods: The study included 154 participants aged 40\\u201360 years with MetS and NAFLD diagnosed by ultrasound. NAFLD was confirmed by MRI in 109 subjects. Participants underwent anthropometric measurements, and biochemistry testing. Estimated GFR (eGFR) was calculated using the CKD-Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula; hyperfiltration was defined as eGFR \\u2265 120 mL/min. Results: Participants with MRI-proven NAFLD showed a worse metabolic profile and higher levels of eGFR than those with no NAFLD. Presence of NAFLD and increased weight were independently associated with an increased probability of presenting hyperfiltration. Conclusions: The present study shows an association between kidney glomerular hyperfiltration and NAFLD in adults with MetS. Establishing an association between NAFLD and kidney glomerular hyperfiltration would help to earlier identify those patients at increased risk of CKD, who would benefit from an early intervention.\",\n          \"Snakebite affects more than 1.8 million people annually. Factors explaining snakebite variability include farmers\\u2019 behaviors, snake ecology and climate. One unstudied issue is how farmers\\u2019 adaptation to novel climates affect their health. Here we examined potential impacts of adaptation on snakebite using individual-based\\u00a0simulations, focusing on strategies meant to counteract major crop yield decline because of changing rainfall in Sri Lanka. For rubber cropping, adaptation led to a 33% increase in snakebite incidence per farmer work hour because of work during risky months, but a 17% decrease in total annual snakebites because of decreased labor in plantations overall. Rice farming adaptation decreased snakebites by 16%, because of shifting labor towards safer months, whereas tea adaptation led to a general increase.

These differ in hemoglobin target and iron levels and their emphasis on various iron markers and other clinical outcomes. Not surprisingly, disparities are observed in anemia treatment strategies among patients with nondialysis CKD across different areas of the world. Over the past decade, the prescription and dosage of both iron therapies and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents have shifted, with notable regional differences observed. Moreover, there is ongoing debate regarding oral versus intravenous administration of iron. Compared with oral iron therapy, which often leads to gastrointestinal adverse events, low patient adherence, and low efficacy, intravenous iron administration has been associated with potential serious adverse events, such as anaphylaxis. New iron\\u2013based compounds and drugs currently under development are reviewed to describe their potential benefits in the treatment of anemia in patients with CKD. New oral compounds, including iron\\u2013based phosphate binders, heme iron polypeptide, and liposomal iron, show different rates of absorption with possibly different efficacy and improved tolerability. These new potential therapies offer health care providers additional anemia treatment options for their patients with CKD; however, the management of anemia in the CKD population continues to present challenges that require prospective studies to identify the optimal iron therapy for patients.\",\n          \"U-insertion/deletion RNA editing is a post-transcriptional mitochondrial RNA modification phenomenon required for viability of trypanosomatid parasites. Small guide RNAs encoded mainly by the thousands of catenated minicircles contain the information for this editing. We analyzed by NGS technology the mitochondrial genomes and transcriptomes of two strains, the old lab UC strain and the recently isolated LEM125 strain. PacBio sequencing provided complete minicircle sequences which avoided the assembly problem of short reads caused by the conserved regions. Minicircles were identified by a characteristic size, the presence of three short conserved sequences, a region of inherently bent DNA and the presence of single gRNA genes at a fairly defined location. The LEM125 strain contained over 114 minicircles encoding different gRNAs and the UC strain only ~24 minicircles. Some LEM125 minicircles contained no identifiable gRNAs. Approximate copy numbers of the different minicircle classes in the network were determined by the number of PacBio CCS reads that assembled to each class. Mitochondrial RNA libraries from both strains were mapped against the minicircle and maxicircle sequences. Small RNA reads mapped to the putative gRNA genes but also to multiple regions outside the genes on both strands and large RNA reads mapped in many cases over almost the entire minicircle on both strands. These data suggest that minicircle transcription is complete and bidirectional, with 3\\u2019 processing yielding the mature gRNAs. Steady state RNAs in varying abundances are derived from all maxicircle genes, including portions of the repetitive divergent region. The relative extents of editing in both strains correlated with the presence of a cascade of cognate gRNAs. These data should provide the foundation for a deeper understanding of this dynamic genetic system as well as the evolutionary variation of editing in different strains.\",\n          \"Seaweeds are increasingly intriguing as a sustainable source of bioactive compounds. They have applications in agriculture, fuels, feed, and food products. To become a cost-competitive product with zero waste, a biorefinery approach is applied, where several products are valorized at the same time. True-Algae-Max (TAM\\u00ae) has been investigated for its ability to improve the yield and nutritional facts of a strawberry plant. Three concentrations of TAM (0, 50, and 100%) were examined by foliar spray in 2017 with 50% NPK chemical fertilizer. Results indicated that growth, yield, chlorophyll, and potassium content were significantly improved by TAM treatments. TAM50 % resulted in maximum root length, leaf area, plant fresh weight, fruit weight, and yield with an increase ranging from 10 to 110% compared to control. Compared to the NPK control, strawberries grown with TAM50% improved total soluble solids (TSS) from 7.58 to 10.12% and anthocyanin from 23.08 to 29.42 mg CGE 100 g\\u22121. Noteworthily, this reduced total sugar, and total phenolics were boosted by TAM applications, while non-reducing sugar was reduced compared to control. On the other hand, whole seaweed biomass and TAM residuals were used for bioethanol production by acid scarification. The maximum bioethanol yield was observed in residual biomass (0.34 g g\\u22121 dw), while the whole seaweed biomass showed only 0.20 g g\\u22121 dw. These results proved the biorefinery concept of using seaweed extract as a biostimulator and bioethanol production.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Paper_type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Journal Article']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Affiliation\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 26006,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Institution of Pathogenic Biology, Medical College, University of South China, Hengyang City, P.R.
