The objective of the study was to determine the effect of Allium sativum and Zingiber officinale extracts against filariasis vectors. The larvae were collected from the breeding site by using standard procedures for identification and larvicidal activities. Twenty grams (20\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0089g) from each (Allium sativum and Zingiber officinale) were extracted separately by aqueous, ethanol, and methanol solvents. The phytochemical analysis was determined in the crude sample by using standard methods. Then, larvicidal effects were determined by introducing 10 larvae of the vectors to the concentrations of 250\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0089ppm, 500\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0089ppm, and 750\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0089ppm of the crude sample, and data were subjected to probit analysis to determine the LC50 and Chi-squared test to check the significance of the mortality by R software. Anopheles funestus, Anopheles gambiae s.l., Anopheles pharoensis, Culex antennatus, and Culex quinquefasciatus were the filariasis vectors identified during the study period. The presence of phytochemical tests such as anthraquinones, flavonoids, glycosides, phenol, saponin, steroids, tannin, and terpenes was obtained. The larvicidal effects of the selected plant extracts ranged from 0%-100%. The lowest LC50 (53\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0089ppm) was observed for A. sativum methanol test extract against Cx. quinquefasciatus. Ethanol extracts of A. sativum have a significant effect on An. funestus (X2 = 7.5, p = 0.02352) and Cx. quinquefasciatus (X2 = 10.833, p = 0.0.0044), whereas aqueous extracts have a significant effect only on An. gambiae s.l. (X2 = 7.0807, p = 0.029. Ethanol extracts of Z. officinale have a significant effect only on the mortality of An. pharoensis (X2 = 7.0807, p = 0.029), but methanol and aqueous extracts have no significant effect against filariasis vectors. In conclusion, A. sativum have a high toxic effect than Z. officinale extract against filariasis vectors in all type of solvents. So using those plant extracts is the best to reduce the risk of the synthetic chemical on nontarget organisms and the environment, in addition to the control of mosquito-borne diseases, but further studies will be conducted to evaluate the toxicity at different stages of the vectors.\",\n          \"The current treatments against Leishmania parasites present high toxicity and multiple side effects, which makes the control and elimination of leishmaniasis challenging. Natural products constitute an interesting and diverse chemical space for the identification of new antileishmanial drugs. To identify new drug options, an in-house database of 360 kauranes (tetracyclic diterpenes) was generated, and a combined ligand- and structure-based virtual screening (VS) approach was performed to select potential inhibitors of Leishmania major (Lm) pteridine reductase I (PTR1). The best-ranked kauranes were employed to verify the validity of the VS approach through LmPTR1 enzyme inhibition assay. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of selected bioactive compounds were examined using the random forest (RF) model (i.e., 2\\u00c3\\u008e\\u00c2\\u00b2-hydroxy-menth-6-en-5\\u00c3\\u008e\\u00c2\\u00b2-yl ent-kaurenoate (135) and 3\\u00c3\\u008e\\u00c2\\u00b1-cinnamoyloxy-ent-kaur-16-en-19-oic acid (302)) were below 10 \\u00c3\\u008e\\u00c2\\u00bcM. A compound similar to 302, 3\\u00c3\\u008e\\u00c2\\u00b1-p-coumaroyloxy-ent-kaur-16-en-19-oic acid (302a), was also synthesized and showed the highest activity against LmPTR1. Finally, molecular docking calculations and molecular dynamics simulations were performed for the VS-selected, most-active kauranes within the active sites of PTR1 hybrid models, generated from three Leishmania species that are known to cause cutaneous leishmaniasis in the new world (i.e., L. braziliensis, L. panamensis, and L. amazonensis) to explore the targeting potential of these kauranes to other species-dependent variants of this enzyme.\",\n          \"Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) are the main olfactory proteins of mosquitoes, and their structures have been widely explored to develop new repellents. In the present study, we combined ligand- and structure-based virtual screening approaches using as a starting point 1633 compounds from 71 botanical families obtained from the Essential Oil Database (EssOilDB). Using as reference the crystallographic structure of N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide interacting with the OBP1 homodimer of Anopheles gambiae (AgamOBP1), we performed a structural and pharmacophoric similarity search to select potential natural products from the library. Thymol acetate, 4-(4-methyl phenyl)-pentanal, thymyl isovalerate, and p-cymen-8-yl demonstrated a favorable chemical correlation with DEET and also had high-affinity interactions with the OBP binding pocket that molecular dynamics simulations showed to be stable. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate on a large scale the potentiality of NPs from essential oils as inhibitors of the mosquito OBP1 using in silico approaches. Our results could facilitate the design of novel repellents with improved selectivity and affinity to the protein binding pocket and can shed light on the mechanism of action of these compounds against insect olfactory recognition.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Paper_type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Journal Article']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Affiliations\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 676,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Department of Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, Ghana', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, Ghana', 'Department of Parasitology, Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, University of Ghana, Legon, Ghana', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, Ghana', 'Department of Pathology, Manhyia District Hospital, Kumasi, Ghana', 'Department of Parasitology, Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, University of Ghana, Legon, Ghana', 'Department of Parasitology, Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, University of Ghana, Legon, Ghana', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, Ghana', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, Ghana']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":2}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Combine all titles into a single text string\n","text = \" \".join(str(title) for title in data['Title'].dropna())\n"],"metadata":{"id":"0_ddi6POQVjs"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Preprocess the text: remove non-alphanumeric characters and lower the text\n","text = re.sub(r'\\W+', ' ', text).lower()"],"metadata":{"id":"l7EJ2mVoQVag"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Remove stopwords\n","stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n","filtered_words = [word for word in text.split() if word not in stop_words]"],"metadata":{"id":"HfzWo1fDQqVk"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Generate a word cloud\n","wordcloud = WordCloud(\n","    width=2000,\n","    height=1000,\n","    background_color='white',\n","    stopwords=stop_words,\n","    max_words=200,\n","    colormap='viridis'\n",").generate(\" \".join(filtered_words))\n","\n","# Plot the word cloud\n","plt.figure(figsize=(16, 6))\n","plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='bilinear')\n","plt.axis('off')\n","#plt.title(\"Word Cloud of Titles from Systematic Review\", fontsize=16)\n","plt.show()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":585,"output_embedded_package_id":"1F3TB8ce4a4rLJV257zB-nFsVyJK30S16"},"id":"3Oy39aPdQqRY","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1738989166954,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":7111,"user":{"displayName":"Aliyu D Abdullahi","userId":"02187426347476081881"}},"outputId":"a9f75018-ca64-4b80-993c-4a6cb37825a5"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Output hidden; open in https://colab.research.google.com to view."},"metadata":{}}]}]}
